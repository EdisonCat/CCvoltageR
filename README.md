# Chopping-controlled Voltage Regulator
## Description
An Arduino-based Chopping-controlled Voltage Regulator can be used to regulate voltage with the control signal produced by Arduino.
And this is a C++ library for Arduino-based Chopping-controlled Voltage Regulator.
## Usage
### On Arduino IDE
Download or clone the library and copy folder CCVRonArduinoIDE/chopping-controlled_voltage_regulator to Arduino/Libraries, and include the header file in your .ino source code.
Then create a new object of class voltage, and use the methods in the class.
### On Visual Studio
Download or clone the library and copy folder CCVRonVisualStudio to your Visual Studio project, and include the header file in your .ino source code.
Then start your development.
